<u><b>Size</b></u>
<sub>Capybaras are the world’s largest rodent. They don’t look like the typical pests living in alleyways, though. Capybaras are as big as large dogs, have webbed feet and don’t have a tail. They don’t have the typical wedge-shaped face of most rodents, either. These rodents look much more like larger versions of their close relatives, guinea pigs. Capybaras are from about 39 to 51 inches (100 to 130 centimeters) long and about 20 inches (50 cm) tall from foot to shoulder. They tend to weigh 60 to 174 lbs. (27 to 79 kilograms), depending on gender. Females are usually a little larger than males.</sub>

<u><b>Habitat</b></u>
<sub>These water-loving rodents need water to keep their dry skin moist and are found only in areas with abundant water sources. Some of their moist habitats include estuaries, marshes, river banks and along streams in Central and South America, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Capybaras, also called water hogs, sleep along the water source in dense vegetation to hide from predators and to keep cool. Sometimes capybaras will nap in mud or shallow water, as well.</sub>

<u><b>Other Facts</b></u>
<sub>Capybaras can stay underwater for up to five minutes at a time, according to the San Diego Zoo. The scientific name for capybara comes from Hydro chaeris, which means "water hog" in Greek. An Amazon tribe calls the capybara Kapiyva or "master of the grasses" in their native language.</sub>
